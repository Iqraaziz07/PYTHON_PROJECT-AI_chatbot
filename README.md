# PYTHON_PROJECT-AI_chatbot
This project is a simple AI chatbot created using **Python* and basic **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** concepts.  
The goal of this project is to understand how chatbots work at a beginner level and how user messages can be processed and answered intelligently.



## What This Chatbot Can Do

- Chat with users through text
- Recognize common messages like greetings, thanks, and goodbyes
- Reply in a friendly and natural way
- Run in the command line
- Work as a small web application using Flask



## Technologies Used

- **Python** – main programming language  
- **NLTK** – for basic text processing  
- **Flask** – to create a simple web interface  
- **HTML** – for displaying chatbot responses



## Project Structure

## How the Chatbot Works

- The user types a message
- The chatbot breaks the message into words using NLP
- Keywords are matched with predefined intents
- A suitable response is selected randomly
- The chatbot displays the response to the user


## How to Run the Project

1.Install Required Libraries
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2.Run the chatbot
```bash
python bot.py
```
3.Run the web version
```bash
python app.py
```

## Future Improvements

- Add more conversation patterns
- Improve chatbot intelligence using machine learning
- Enhance the web interface
- Add voice-based interaction

*Built with python and Nltk.*
